# trello-app

npm run dev to get started

npm start runs the app in production mode

Both need Heroku's foreman (npm run getheroku)

---------------

If deploying, you need to set environment / config variables in Heroku: 

- APP_NAME - name of the Angular App to load
- TRELLO_KEY - your Trello developers public key
